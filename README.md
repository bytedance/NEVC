# **NEVC** - **N**eural **E**fficient **V**ideo **C**oding

</div>

**NEVC** is a neural video coding framework designed for highly efficient video compression. By integrating cutting-edge neural network models, NEVC pushes the boundaries of encoding performance and efficiency.

This repository provides access to code, pretrained models, and research papers for various versions of NEVC.
